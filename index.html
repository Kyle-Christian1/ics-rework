          <p>
            ICS has been providing qualified crews to work at our clients'
            facilities for the support of operations for many years. We can
            provide a full range of craft, operations, labor or technical
            personnel in both large and small numbers. These crews will be led
            by ICS supervisory personnel who can direct the day to day tasks
            requested by the client. The employees on the crew remain ICS
            employees throughout their assignment and all statutory taxes,
            insurance and benefits are provided by ICS. Clients pay hourly
            billing rate for all hours worked and at the end of the assignment,
            workers are reassigned to other ICS clients or are released —
            thereby the customer is relieved of termination paperwork and
            administration. ICS will work with the client's Human Resources and
            Environmental Safety and Health departments to make sure our
            policies and procedures do not conflict with the client's policies
            and procedures. Daily work, incident reports and safety meeting are
            all handled by our administration staff. This allows the client to
            focus on their core business not our employees.
